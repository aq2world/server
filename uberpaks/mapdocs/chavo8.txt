Description             : Map for Action Quake (http://action.telefragged.com).
                          This map it's based on mexican TV program called 
                          "El Chavo del 8". This map includes four small (houses) rooms,
                          a sewer system, two yards & a avenue.
                          Suitable for 2-12 players.

Installation            : Unzip Chavo8.zip into root of your Action Quake game folder 			  			  (Quake2/Action), with Subdirectories enabled (!), so that 
			  all textures and sky will be unzipped into correct directory 
                          (USE FOLDER NAMES checkbox in WinZip or -d switch in PKUnZip).
