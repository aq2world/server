You are in the mountains. It's daytime and the sun is in the sky. 
It's a miners place, but where are everyone? You are dripping 
with sweat and you hear an eagle high above...


This is a map we started a couple of months back (spring season). 
We experienced a lot of problems with exchanging the project 
files, since we use different editors - Quark and Worldcraft. 
Due to all these problems we both lost interest and abandoned 
the map...
But after some conversations we convinced each other to do 
something about it. So here it is.

A pretty large map with lot's of suprising routes. The map 
is devided into 2 sides - one very high up and one lower. 
You are surrounded by rock walls. The theme is a miners 
work place with heavy buidings, a bell tower, caves, sand and 
yellow grass. Large opened areas for sniping, but sneaky 
paths for the more quiet player. Many obsticles to hide behind 
in case of a fire fight. Sound triggers might reveal your location.

Have fun playing this map and try to avoid falling down the 
bell tower! :)
