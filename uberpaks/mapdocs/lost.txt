The Lost City
-By SoD

So... 
its been about a year and a half since my last release
so i figured i might as well do another one. This map is a bit 
different tho. Took me close to 2 months to build, and took vito 2 days
and 19 hours to compile. Would have taken my machine even longer. 
I was only halfway done when he finished. <3 vito!

Anyways its a ruined city type setting with a river that goes down 
the middle. It has some jumpy parts to it which i like but still think 
their could have been more jumps. Thats just me tho, i tend to focus more
on the jumps normally. This map i kind of did something different.
I went for more detail instead of jumpy and it turned out alright.

There are ctf flag positions included with this map.
I also want to say that I didnt go crazy with a surfgen on this map.
I handcrafted everything on here.

Hope you like it!
