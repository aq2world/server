This is a map created after the idea by Dark Lord. He has helped me
when my mind was empty. Thanks!

I have used a texture that is named "snb_floor3"... I don`t know who
made this, sorry for not crediting you!

This is a teamplay map, with two bases, one supposed to be terror and
the other some kinda army base.

Have fun!!
