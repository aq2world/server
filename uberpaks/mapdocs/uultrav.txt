Title			: Ultra UltraViolence

Description		: This is a remake of a Q1 DM level UltraViolence 
			  created by Adriano Lorenzini.	 The layout is fairly
			  open and the multi-level architecture will test your
			  situational awareness for wrath can come as easily
			  from above as from below.  There are essentially
			  four interconnected rooms and a number of
			  teleporters to help overcome certain space-time 
			  constraints and to intensify the level of play.

			  There is absolutely no safe place to camp.  The quad
			  damage artifact is on a tall pillar to which you
			  have to teleport from the central room by opening a
			  door via a push button and madly dashing towards the
			  teleporter.  Should something get in your way, the
			  door is likely to close and you have to try again -
			  if you live that long.
 
			  My initial doubts about the level being able to
			  match the intensity of its Q1 ancestor proved to be
			  quite unsubstantiated.  Despite the slower rocket
			  speed and lesser splash damage radius in Q2, the
			  level plays as well as the original does - it is
			  absolute madness!  I have done extensive play
			  testing (such a rough job I tell you) not only with
			  the bots, but with live bait as well.	 The potent
			  arsenal of three rocket launchers, a grenade
			  launcher, hyperblaster and a pair of super shotguns
			  along with the hand-grenades combined with the
			  layout characteristics make the level ultra
			  ultra-violent indeed.
  
			  The original author reportedly lost the source to
			  this Q1 master-piece in a tragic disk crash so the
			  original blue prints were lost.  I tried to keep the
			  layout and architecture proportions as true to the
			  original as I could.	Alas, I had to chose a
			  different texture scheme as I was not willing to pay
			  the price of distributing custom textures with the
			  .bsp.	 However, while I kept the original arsenal
			  intact, I felt that the super shotgun needed to be
			  here as it is such an awesome Q2 addition and
			  therefore I added two of them along with some spare
			  shells to feed the twin barrels of wrath.
			  Hyperblaster serves well in place of the lightning
			  bolt - especially when combined with the quad.
