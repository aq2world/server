Known Bugs              : I din`t know if this is abug, but I can`t fix it. It`s something 
                          wrong with the flashing lights somewhere. Not very noticable, though...                        
Build Time              : Lets see... I worked on it 4-5 days
                          off and to.
Compile Time		: About 9 hours, according to Dark Lord, the compiler

Notes:

Does the map run slow? Make the textures smaller. In general, the map SHOULDN`T run slow...
(Thanks Pat)

Wanna use SLAT Software textures? Give me some credits! Thanks... It took hell of a
long time to convert/make those textures!

OK. I have NOT used any prefabs, I have built them all myself, so if you see them in
someone`s other maps, please report to me... Probably the guy got them from me, but please
let me know anyway.
