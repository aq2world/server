Description             : Deathmatch Quake II Level

This map is a sort of temple with some pretty wonky architecture.  Feel
free to offer your prayers to the Strogg gods, but I'd recommend using
actions instead of words.  Your attendance to all the weapon and powerup
stations will be richly rewarded with the Railgun, Rocket Launcher,
Grenade Launcher, two Super Shotguns, Quad, and Megahealth.  There is
also a smattering of ammo and health just laying around for the taking.
Use them wisely and the gods will bless you with many frags.

The temple is best worshipped by 2 to 4 mortals at one time.

Even more than usual, I recommend playing with "weapons stay" turned on.
A 2-player game would probably be OK without it, but even 1 more player
and there wouldn't be enough to go around.

========================================================================

* Running the Map *

Put Lush.bsp into your maps directory (Quake2\baseq2\maps).  Run
Quake2 and bring down the console (by pressing ~).  At the console,
type "map lush".  The game will start.  For multiplayer games, start
the game first.  Then bring down the console and enter the map command.
Each player must have the .bsp file in his/her map directory.

I've also included the .rtz file in this release.  If you don't have the
Eraser Bot, you can delete this file.  If you do have it, drop lush.rtz
into your Quake2\eraser\routes directory before starting the map with
bots.

* Other Info *

I aimed once again for a 1-on-1 sized level, and I think I hit it pretty
well this time.  It may seem a bit on the large size, but the
connectivity makes for very quick surveys of the entire level.  If all
else fails, go to the GL room and pop grenades every direction until you
hear the sound of pain.

My last few maps were a big step up with connectivity and level flow,
but weren't very architecturally interesting.  This one is where I tried
to repeat their smooth flow, but add in the pretty lighting of Solid
Fuel, the kind of cool texturing I did in Stellar Cow, plus some rather
fanciful architectural elements.
