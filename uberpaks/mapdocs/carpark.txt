Thanks:		To members of [TNN], the organisers and users of the AQMD Test Matrix forum who have suggested
		ideas and given encouragement, Tragedy Trousers for the Animal Magic MP3 (converted to WAV file),
		Id software for Quake 2, MJC for the sky "c2nite" I used (very nice!), the authors of the editing tools
		I used, the Action Team	for AQ2 - probably the best Quake 2 modification ever, Eusa at Planet Online
		for hosting Carpark BETA 2.3 for testing by [TNN] and thanks to the many authors of map tutorials hosted
		on sites such as Rust, etc.  And last, but not least, much respect to Johnny Morris for Animal Magic. ;)

Map Description
===============
A long-deserted urban carpark, somewhere in a city or town, somewhere (use your imagination) ;)

Loosely based on multi-story carparks found in the UK, mainly from memory, and from any that I might have seen on television
or in films.  I've tried to keep it as simple as possible for gameplay reasons and to keep r_speeds to a minimum, but as
this is an outdoor map with many windows, this means r_speeds will generally be higher than an indoor map.

Gameplay Info
=============
Single Player:		Just for taking a look around.
Cooperative:		No.
Deathmatch:		2-10.
Teamplay:		2-10 players.
Difficulty Settings:	None.
New Graphics:		Yes, a few of my own textures, the rest are from Quake 2 and a couple of other AQ2 maps.
New Sky:		Yes. "c2nite" by MJC aka Muzman. (fluxion@ii.net)
New Sounds:		Yes. The fluorescent lamp sound and the lift music.

Construction
============
Base used:		None, but inspired by 'ParkGarage', author unknown.
Editors/Tools used:	QuArK 5.10, Wally 1.50B, PaintShop Pro 6, SoundForge 4.5, MapSpy 1.0.
Build machine:		Celeron 566 (o/c to 637MHz), 128Mb PC100 RAM, 17.3Gb IDE Harddisk, GeForce 2 GTS.
Construction time:	Estimated 8 to 10 weeks, on and off.

Build Times:		TXQBSP took 5 seconds.
			QVIS3 took 1326 seconds. (Used QVis3 rather than TimVis, which has a HOM bug)
			ARGHRAD took 7799 seconds.

Installation
============
Unzip the map archive into your "action" directory, making sure you enable subdirectories/paths.

Map Notes
=========
This version of Carpark is a second revision of Carpark, which I originally submitted to the Action Quake Map Depot.

Changes in this revision:

* Created own billboard logo, which hopefully should fix the weird "scaling" bug present in the first submission.
* Changed the texture for the wall under the chain-link fence.  Texture taken from a site dedicated to free textures.
* Changed the "mine lamp" light entities on roof of carpark to brushes, which emit own lightsource.
* Lowered the volume/smoothed the waveform for the fluorescent lamp wav file - hopefully should be less "annoying" ;)
* Added buttons inside lift shaft for each floor, so lift doors can be re-opened after closing.
