Description             : Deathmatch Quake II Level

The main room is filled with catwalks and open to space above and below.
At the bottom, there is a big fan and a ventilation intake that ensures
your safety should you be careless enough to fall off.  Around this room
you will find some smaller side rooms that are well-connected to each
other and to the center room.  The level sports 2 Rocket Launchers, a
Railgun, a Hyperblaster, a Super Shotgun, and a Chaingun.  Topping off
the heavy artillery is a Quad, conveniently placed under a lift tube so
that you can quickly jump back into the action.  Defensive equipment
includes a Body Armor, a Jacket Armor, and a Megahealth.  Ammo isn't
exactly overstocked, but there is enough to keep everyone equipped with
what they need.

Yeah, I know that a big fan open to space below makes no sense
whatsoever, but hey- it looks cool (at least I think so).

As usual, I strongly recommend playing with "weapons stay" turned on.

And a special thanks goes out to Bod (bod@planetquake.com) for doing the
route file with no prior notice.  And for giving me a couple of hints on
what to do to make the map more bot-friendly.

========================================================================

* Running the Map *

Put Stellar.bsp into your maps directory (Quake2\baseq2\maps).  Run
Quake2 and bring down the console (by pressing ~).  At the console,
type "map stellar".  The game will start.  For multiplayer games, start
the game first.  Then bring down the console and enter the map command.
Each player must have the .bsp file in his/her map directory.

I've also included the .rtz file in this release.  If you don't have the
Eraser Bot, you can delete this file.  If you do have it, drop
stellar.rtz into your Quake2\eraser\routes directory before starting the
map with bots.

* Other Info *

Like my last map, Solid Fuel, I was aiming for a level sized for 1-on-1
games.  However, this time it ended up a little larger than I intended.
It is a touch on the large size for 2 players, but 3 is enough to see
some good action.  It's large enough that it should take up to 6 or so
players comfortably.  8-10 players might even work, but that would be
pretty full.
