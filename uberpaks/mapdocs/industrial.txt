Build notes:            : I accidentally compiled and older .map version before
                          the release of industrial. This caused me to release
                          a version that had about 25% higher r_speeds than
                          this version. I noticed it a couple of days later
                          when I was playing online and noticed lag. This version
                          also contains some more clips to fix the stuck-points
                          that were discovered after the release. Sorry for
                          the inconvenience :(

Description             : Map for Action Quake (http://action.telefragged.com).

                          The map features an industrial area, complete with a
                          car repair shop, timber yard, silos, and various
                          light industrial buildings. Take a stroll in the
                          settings sun, and the gangs that flood the area this
                          time of day.

Installation            : Unzip industrial.zip into the root of your Action Quake
                          game folder (quake2/action), with subdirectories
                          enabled (!)
