Ah, yes. It's finally here!  The map everyone fell in love with years ago
has finally been completed.  Yes, after many hard days of work I have 
come out with my first official release.

This map was designed for action quake 2

Do not revise this map in any way, or you will force me to find you,
and personally kick your ass.

=================================================================

Installation:

To install this map simply place all the folders into your quake2\action
dir


==================================================================

I want to thank the following....

KC aka kickboy12:
you have helped me solve many problems, and have given me ideas and
insights.  without KC i could not have completed this map.  Thank you
kc, and i <3 you from the depts of my heart.

Trinity:
thanks for providing a server for the map to flow out through into the 
public.  If it weren't for you trinity, all the fans reading this today
would not have found out about this map.

Potato:
PoT, you motivated me through all those hard times.  When i said this 
map will never be done, you were there to say yes it will.
When i was thinking, this map sucks, you were saying no it doesnt.
when i walk through the shadow of the valley of death, you were 
there pushing me onward. I could go on with the list all day but I've 
decided not to bore you all and so I'll be getting straight to the point.
Pot your my hero, my idol in everyway. I worship you. And my next map
release will be dedicated to you.


Thank you all reading this for the support.  Just downloading the map 
means more to me than anything.


now everyone grab a tissue, cuz this was an emotional moment...
