Handgrenade

More to be added later


Items

No items are aviable yet.


Features

FTD - Fetch the drug:
This is a new version of CTF with one Terror team, and one Police team.

Locational Damage

Weapons don't respawn:
This means if you have picked up the uzi ones, it would never apear there if
you don't die in the same place or drop it out there.
In other words, Throw it away if you don't want any other 
to have it, or want to hide it to some other time

Blood splats

Bullet holes

Team damage:
What ever you do, Never, ever, ever shoot a teammate!!!
If you do, you get 5 frags less.
This is to make it realistic, and make those evil guys who shoot 
their freinds stop that. (like Trond)  Not just pure evil!  8)

Death penalty:
Do not get killed! If you do you get 1 frag less.
Suicide makes it 2 frags less.
This is to make you dont take to many chances just running in and fire your guns.

Bad aim at speed:
Kneel-best accuracy
Stand-normal accuracy
Run-bad accuracy

Bad aim at low health:
Lesser life makes bader accuracy

Manualy opening doors


This are the primary features.
I belive there are more that I cant remember.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Pretty handy information:


There are some stuff you may want to write if you dont like playing around without reloading and the capability to open doors. You need to type this in your .cfg or in the console:

bind x opendoor
bind x reload

where x are the character you want to use.

If you want to throw the grenade loger, you have to press the fire button once more when he is about to throw it, you will disturb him in his "pull the hand back for throwing the grenade" anmation, and make him focus and throw longer. Press it longer to throw it even longer.
