Map oneday.bsp

Twist and i drew this shit out, we had a playable version in 1 day(oneday). then about a week and a half later we have this...

the idea was a map that flows with ways to get up and down with out being camped like crappy urban3.. :) so its not as hot as those euro's latest works... but on the other hand it only took a week or so workin on it most weekdays...

give it a shot flows pretty sweetly, as was the plan of the man with pen in his hand.. fuckin twisted! Oh we got so drunk that night, remember cunt jess's pub crawl, fark didnt even sleep.. anyway...


took about 5 hours to compile
