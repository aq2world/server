Comments: If Hidden2 took me a week to make, this one took atleast 
	  a month. Been working differently with this one, very 
	  much on and off. Some day 15 minutes, next day maybe 2 
	  hours..

	  Differs very much from the previous Hidden maps, but still 
	  stays loyal and true to its theme. This one features a more 
	  opened and fast paced game. Had to take a different approach 
	  with this one, since the Hidden series isn't too poupular. :-/

	  It has been very healthy to work on this map. I experienced 
	  many obstacles this time, but I never gave up. Neither did 
	  I settle with something I wasn't fully satisfied with.

	  Hope you enjoy this map, it has been really fun making!
