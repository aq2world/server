Notes:

This is my 3rd released map. You want the two previous ones, take
a look at members.xoom.com/actionmaps or mail me... Give me some
feedback!!! (I have a faster ver of village.zip!!)

* Copyright / Permissions *

Copyright? I think I broke a couple of rules doing this level, so feel
free to do whatever you want... I haven`t asked the 3DRealms dudes if
I could "borrow" some of their textures... Hope they won`t sue me!

However, I would be pleased if you let me know if you used some of my
stuff, but only if you feel for it. You see, I had a hell of time
converting those textures!!!
