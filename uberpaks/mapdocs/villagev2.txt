Village

Author:      Trond Abusdal, SLAT Software

Description: I have built a level that contains an old motel and a
             swimming pool. This version is the final. Nothing 
             more to say, except that there is not ONE of the original
             Q2 textures... Have fun!

Build time:  2-3 days off and to
Compile time:Two hours
Deathmatch:  Yes! The only thing the level was built for... 8 starts I
             think.
Bugs:        Not as I can find.
Mod:         I would NOT recommend to play this level not using AQ2,
             action.telefragged.com

A tip:       The mastermind of AQ2 wouldn`t have this level because it
             was so slow... But, with some help from Patrick Simmons,
             ( www.planetquake.com/qsb) who told me that the smaller
             textures, the lesser memory required to run smooth... So,
             I simply resized all of the large textures to 64-64
             textures... Now it runs like a dream!!!

Special thanks to Patrick J. Simmons...
