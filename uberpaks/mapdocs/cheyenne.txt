Description             : This level was designed for ActionQuake.  It can be played in regular Q2,
                          But I've never tried it and I'm guessing that item placement would be whack.
                          I can't wait to get some 5 on 5 team games going on this bad boy.

                          Speaking of which, this map will be running on my AQ2 server, which I have plans
                          to run indefinately. (or until I get sick of AQ2)  The address is:

                                        p60.canweb.net:27910 or 128.143.59.115:27910

Credits                 : Avatar (Mackey McCandlish) for a beautiful environment map.  Sure beats _unit1!
                          Geoffrey DeWan for making the GDD Compiling Utils.  Viva the _sun command!
