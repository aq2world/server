Description             : A city-style map for Action Quake (http://aq2.action-web.net).
                          It has some dark corners so it should be cool for all 
                          you sneaky bastards with snipers or handcannons. :)
                          There's also open areas for the automonkeys. 
                          Anyways, this is our first map so don't expect it to be 
                          top notch quality. We were just learning to use the tools.
                          Have fun and remember: FAEN 0w|\|5 j00!
                          
Installation            : Unzip gangbang.zip into root of your Action Quake
                          game folder (Quake2/Action), with Subdirectories
                          enabled (!), so that all textures and sounds will be
                          unzipped into correct directories (USE FOLDER NAMES
                          checkbox in WinZip or -d switch in PKUnZip).
                                                    
Additional Credits to   : Ruskprick, CryptR and Gerbil! for textures.
                          And of course Kalle Klovn for the |337 song!
